    HTTPS:
    <br>
    Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure is the secure version of HTTP, which is the protocol over which data is sent between a persons browser and the website.
    Data sent through HTTPS gets encrypted to make it more secure.
    If the data is not encrypted, passwords and other sensitive data will be sent in plaintext.
    <br>
    JWT:
    <br>
    JSON webtokens is a way for the client to authenticate to the server. A JWT consists of a header, a payload and a signature.
    The header consists usually of 2 fields, that it is a JWT and the signing algorithm that's used.
    The payload consists of information about the user.
    The signature consists of the header, the payload and a secret, which is then hashed. The secret is supposed to only live on the server which makes it very secure.
    It's is practically impossible to dehash a token without knowing the secret.
    <br>
Oauth2:
    <br>
    Oauth2 allows third party applications, such as facebook or google to grant access to some of its features and information (not passwords) to
    HTTP services. If you're using Oauth2 you can more or less skip creating an authentication provider of your own.
    When you create a google service you're provided with a secret and clientId, which the server then uses to connect to your oauth2 service.
